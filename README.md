This repository contains the data, results and code distribution for Physics Laboratory II experience "Virgo_DA_cosmo: Study of the systematics due to galaxiesâ€™ intrinsic luminosity for gravitational wave cosmology".

To run the notebooks you will need a working copy of Python3 with standard packages such as numpy and scipy.

# Short description of the content

- gal4H0_luminosity.py: Python module from https://github.com/simone-mastrogiovanni/hitchhiker_guide_dark_sirens , for simulating mock data and calculating the likelihood as function of H0. Some functions are updated to the the case in which we have a non negligible intrinsic luminosity dependence.

- H0analysis.ipynb: Do the analysis for various number of GW events exploring different cases for the GW likelihood.
